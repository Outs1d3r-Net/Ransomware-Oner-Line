# Ransomware-Oner-Line
This is a code for ransomware in bash script oner line. !!! PURELY FOR ACADEMICAL PURPOSES !!!  

I am not responsible in any way for the misuse of this script, this is code normally installed in any linux distribution  
that has been bundled in a way to encrypt all data using AES-CBC-256 encryption with openssl.  

This script was developed for the purpose of sanitizing physical storage drives for disposal to NIST-800-88 standard  

With great powers, great responsibilities...
